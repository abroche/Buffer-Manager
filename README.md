# Buffer-Manager

### Project description:
"In this project, you will learn and implement the key concepts of buffer management as done in database management
systems. Although the project will not be done within a real DBMS, you will simulate the actions taken by the buffer
manager as we learnt in class.
In traditional DBMS a table consists of multiple data blocks. In our simplified project, a “table” will correspond to a
“directory” in the file system, and a “data block” will correspond to a small “file” under this directory. Then, each DB
record will correspond to a line in one of these files. In our context, all files have the exact same size. Each file stores
100 records (i.e., 100 lines), and each record (line) is 40 bytes. You can observe that each file will be of size roughly
“4KB”, which mimics a disk block."
